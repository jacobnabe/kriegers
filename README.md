R package created for reading, plotting and manipulating animal track data. It extends the functionality in adehabitatLT by making it possible to generate new positions along the track that are evenly spaced in space (or time), which is preferable when calculating space use statistics such as Area Restricted Search Scale or residence time. It builds on the sp package for plotting, and enables addition of new variables to tracks based on underlying raster files.
The package was created 2015-02-09, but re-built 2018-04-12.
